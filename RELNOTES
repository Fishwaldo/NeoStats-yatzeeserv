Important information you should know: (READ THIS!)
==============================================================================

This is an alpha release. Not all features will work and there may be major 
bugs in the software. This release is purely for us to get feedback on the new 
version of NeoStats and should not be run on production networks. This release
is ideal for users with test networks or those that want an opportunity to 
help us develop the new version with feedback and suggestions. 

No support is provided for this release so if you have problems and are unable 
to resolve them using the provided documentation, you should use the supported 
stable 2.5 series instead until NeoStats 3.0 is further along. 

Bugs, requests and suggestions should be reported using the bug tracking 
system. You must provide all information required as listed in the README 
section on support or your entry will be removed.

Settings and data files from 2.5.x will not work with 3.0. Settings for a1 
may not be compatible with this version. You should delete all files with
"config" in the filename from the directory ~/NeoStats 3.0/data before 
using this version.
